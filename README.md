# POS_tagging_with_neural_architectures

Text corpora tagged with Part-of-Speech (POS)
information are helpful in many areas. In this
work, we tuned and evaluated a few modifica-
tions of a baseline BiDirectional LSTM archi-
tecture on a corpus annotated with POS tags.
The best models (LSTM and GRU) performed
roughly 0.83 and 0.56 considering the Accuracy and Macro F1-Score criteria respectively.
We then analyzed the results and investigated
possible causes for the errors.
